# Node-Autoticket
This is a project heavy-inspired by the excelent [AutoTicketProject](https://github.com/cmrfrd/AutoTicketProject) by [Alexander Comerford](https://github.com/cmrfrd).
This is, however, implemented in Javascript (NodeJS).

I started this project to help with repeated ticket creation in my work, were we use the CA Service Desk Manager© software.

The goals of this project are:
- Batch creation of Tickets via CSV/XLSX files
- Ticket creation via a CLI interface
- Automatic Ticket creation based on clipboard contents

Please take note: the code is in early stages, so do not expect any functionality.
